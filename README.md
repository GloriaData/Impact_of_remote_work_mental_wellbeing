# Impact of Remote Work on Employee Mental Well-Being

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how remote and hybrid work models impact employee mental well-being, focusing on stress levels, social isolation, job satisfaction, productivity, and mental health conditions.

The analysis was conducted using Power BI on a dataset of 5,000 employees across different job roles, industries, demographics, and regions.

## Objectives
- Understand workforce demographics and work arrangements
- Identify patterns in stress, isolation, and satisfaction
- Determine key drivers of mental well-being challenges
- Provide data-driven recommendations for remote work policies

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization)
- GitHub (Project Documentation)

## Key Insights
- Work arrangements are evenly distributed across remote, hybrid, and onsite employees
- 34% of employees report high stress, while 40% experience high social isolation
- Stress varies more by job role than by work location
- Younger employees (18–24) show lower satisfaction levels
- Mental health challenges among remote workers are diverse, with anxiety and burnout slightly more prevalent

## Deliverables
- Power BI dashboard (.pbix)
- Exploratory data analysis report
- Actionable recommendations for organizations
