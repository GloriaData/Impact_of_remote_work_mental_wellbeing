# Impact of Remote Work on Employee Mental Well-Being  
**Exploratory Data Analysis using Power BI**

---

## 1. Introduction

The modern workplace is rapidly evolving, with remote and hybrid work models becoming increasingly common across industries. While these models offer flexibility and the potential for improved work-life balance, they also raise concerns related to employee stress, social isolation, and overall mental health.

This project analyzes how remote work influences employee mental well-being using a dataset of 5,000 employees worldwide. The analysis leverages Power BI to explore patterns, identify key drivers, and provide actionable recommendations for organizations.

## 2. Objectives

The objectives of this analysis are to:

- Examine workforce demographics and work arrangements  
- Explore patterns in stress, social isolation, satisfaction, and productivity  
- Identify key drivers of mental well-being challenges  
- Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations for improving remote work policies  

---

## 3. Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on 5,000 employees across multiple regions and industries. Key variables include:

- **Work Arrangement:** Remote, Hybrid, Onsite  
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Region, Years of Experience  
- **Mental Well-Being Indicators:** Stress Level, Social Isolation Rating, Job Satisfaction  
- **Other Factors:** Productivity Change and Mental Health Conditions  

---

## 4. Data Preparation

Data cleaning and preparation were performed in Power BI using Power Query. The following steps were applied:

- Validated and corrected data types  
- Handled missing values by labeling them as *“Not Reported”*  
- Trimmed and standardized text fields to ensure consistency  
- Created analytical groupings such as **Age Bands** and **Experience Bands**  
- Derived flags to identify employees experiencing **high social isolation**  

These steps ensured the dataset was suitable for accurate exploratory analysis and visualization.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 5.1 Workforce Composition

The workforce is evenly distributed across work arrangements:

- 34% Remote  
- 33% Hybrid  
- 33% Onsite  

This balanced distribution enables fair comparison across work models and ensures that observed differences in outcomes are not driven by sample imbalance.

---

### 5.2 Stress, Isolation, and Satisfaction

Key mental well-being indicators reveal the following patterns:

- 34% of employees report high stress  
- 40% of employees experience high social isolation  
- Job satisfaction is evenly split among satisfied, neutral, and unsatisfied employees  

These findings suggest that flexibility alone does not guarantee positive employee well-being outcomes.

---

### 5.3 Demographic and Role-Based Patterns

- Remote work is dominated by employees aged **25–44**  
- Employees with **16+ years of experience** are more likely to work remotely  
- Higher stress levels are observed in roles such as **Project Managers, Designers, Sales, and Data Scientists**  

This indicates that job role and experience level play a significant role in shaping mental well-being outcomes.

---

### 5.4 Mental Health Conditions and Productivity

Among remote employees:

- **Anxiety and burnout** are the most frequently reported mental health conditions  
- Productivity outcomes are evenly split between **increase**, **no change**, and **decrease**  

This highlights the diverse experiences employees have with remote work, both positive and negative.

---

### 5.5 Driver Analysis

Decomposition and driver analysis show that high stress is more concentrated among:

- Remote employees  
- Designers  
- Employees aged **25–34**  
- Non-binary employees  
- Certain regions (e.g., Asia)  

These results emphasize that mental well-being risks increase when multiple factors intersect, underscoring the need for targeted interventions.

---

## 6. Key Findings

- Stress and social isolation affect a significant portion of the workforce  
- Social isolation is more prevalent than stress, particularly among remote workers  
- Stress varies more by **job role** than by work location  
- Younger employees (18–24) show lower satisfaction levels  
- Mental health challenges among remote workers are diverse and not limited to a single condition  

---

## 7. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Implement a **multi-focus mental health program** addressing anxiety, burnout, and depression  
2. Introduce **remote-specific stress controls**, including meeting limits and clear workload boundaries  
3. Provide **targeted support for high-stress job roles** such as project managers and designers  
4. Strengthen **early-career support** through mentorship, structured onboarding, and social connection  
5. Design **inclusive well-being initiatives** to support vulnerable demographic groups  

---

## 8. Limitations

- The dataset is cross-sectional and does not imply causation  
- Mental health indicators are self-reported and may contain bias  
- Some analyses rely on counts rather than percentages, which may affect comparisons  

---

## 9. Conclusion

While remote work offers flexibility and autonomy, it also introduces challenges related to stress and social isolation. These challenges are not uniform across employees and are influenced by job role, experience level, demographic factors, and region. Organizations that adopt data-driven and targeted well-being strategies are better positioned to support a healthy, productive, and engaged remote workforce.
